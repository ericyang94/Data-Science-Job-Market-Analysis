Roughly 2 million kids view our content on a weekly basis alone. While we are proud of this accomplishment, we have an ambitious goal of reaching every elementary school student in the country. In short, we are growing quickly and with growth...comes lots of data!  As a Data Scientist at Mystery.org, you will be granted the freedom to use your data analytics and experimentation skills across the organization. You'll join a 4 person Growth team made up of 2 other data scientists, a lead growth engineer, and our Director of Growth. You’ll work cross-functionally to answer our most important questions by innovating and uncovering breakthroughs.  You will report to Huey Kwik, our Director of Growth. We are headquartered in San Francisco and this position is open to both local and remote US-based candidates.  About You Can you translate questions from non-technical stakeholders into decisions that can be answered with data? Can you communicate complicated/foreign concepts or methodology to non-experts? Are you familiar with Python? Numerical & analytical programming (i.e. pandas, scipy, etc)? SQL? Experimentation? Do you have basic proficiency in statistics and statistical modeling? Do you have experience, knowledge or interest in one or more of the following areas: Practical A/B testing for websites, feature engineering, predictive modeling (including using models in production), familiarity with machine learning algorithms? About Mystery.org  At Mystery.org, we believe it’s important that children stay curious as they grow up. We will ensure that the next generation sees it’s an amazing world we live in, full of possibility and wonder — and that they learn how to figure things out for themselves.  We’re doing this by building the missing internet for children. Our first tool was created for children to use in the classroom. We have teachers signed up from 89% of elementary schools in the U.S. and now 50% of schools use us every month. We’ve created one of the fastest-growing learning resources and a brand that is loved by children. Now, we’re developing a new version of our product for parents and children to use at home.  For three years running, our sales have doubled. We’ve exceeded $10M in annual recurring revenue and are growing quickly.  When we talk about “the missing internet for children,” we intend to give children an experience that grownups take for granted: the ability to instantly explore anything they wonder about. Most adults don't realize how inaccessible knowledge is to children. For their first ten years of life, any time a child wonders something all they can do is ask grownups: parents at home and teachers at school. There are 1 billion children in the world today, and we’re making it possible for them to explore their questions, wherever they are. Over the past decade, grownups have been given this superpower but children have been left behind. So we're collecting every question children ask and creating video explanations for all of them. We think this will be the most important learning tool ever created.  Meet The Team  On your first day at Mystery.org, you’ll meet a group of 50 people who are passionate about learning and who each love their respective crafts. Our co-founder, Doug Peltz, began by assembling a team of the best explainers in the world from the Exploratorium, Klutz, Stanford, the Field Museum, and leading private schools.

Our Mission Aware Healthcare is on a mission to build the “thermometer for the mind”: a digital medical device that delivers real-time measures of clinical risk to providers, about their patients, at the moments they need it most. The current gold-standard of evaluation in psychiatry are pen & paper surveys that provide subjective, episodic, high-burden, and clinic-based measures of risk. Our thermometer allows providers to check the ‘mental temperature' of their patients — in an objective, continuous, ecological, and passive fashion — at any time. Our Vision With our thermometer, providers know who needs help, and when they need it. Not only does this shine light into the black box that currently defines life outside the clinic, but it allows providers to deliver just-in-time interventions to patients before it's too late. Trust in providers grows when patients know they're being looked out for. Population health flourishes when high-risk gets detected early. Per capita costs plummet when rates of readmission are reduced. Welcome to the triple-aim of healthcare. We envision a world where we all have the vocabulary to describe how we're mentally feeling; self-awareness to identify when we're heading down a dark path; and tools to get help in minutes not weeks. We can't manage what we don't measure, so we see no more important problem than this for technology in healthcare. Our Why We are starting with addiction for several reasons. For one, it seems we've all been affected by or lost friends and family who have struggled with this chronic disease. Two, addiction is the most costly, preventable, and unmanaged disease in America; costing our nation over $700 billion per year and leading to over 70 other comorbid medical conditions. Three, most digital health companies have run away from addiction, because they see the problem as ‘too hard'; the patients as ‘unmanageable'; the suffering as ‘inevitable'. With over 16% of Americans meeting criteria for clinical addiction, and another 32% classifying as risky users, we see this as too big of a problem to ignore. Join us in redefining what it means to know thyself, reconsidering how we measure population health, and revolutionizing the way we manage mental healthcare. Join us at Aware Healthcare. How We Will Collaborate: Culture & Values Work Culture We're a small team looking for someone who's passionate about democratizing self-knowledge; relentless about getting help to those who need it most. You should be comfortable exploring outside your comfort zone; be ready to learn and constantly take on new challenges. You should be known by your colleagues for never compromising on quality, while always moving quickly. On our team, no one is expected to know everything, but everyone is expected to be capable of learning independently, and applying that knowledge effectively. This is a fast-paced role with many concurrent responsibilities, and it comes with a great deal of ownership. Chances are you will grow more in this role than any other role of your career. This idea should excite you, rather than scare you. Team Values Being on the Aware Healthcare team means you... Take ownership: the buck stops at you; you are individually responsible. Are proactive: you take initiative; identify problems before they happen. Embrace risk: take courageous & calculated risks; no one gets banished for making mistakes. Are radically candid: you expect truth and nothing but the truth; give & take constructive criticism. Have a growth-mindset: we believe you can always be better & you should too; no one has ever ‘made it'. Are insatiably curious: you have a desire to understand the world that can never be fully satisfied. Practice humility: you don't know everything and you never will; embrace that and learn. Focus on humans: always feel into the human experience at the other end of the machine. Are playful: you work hard, laugh hard, and crack jokes in meetings. Think slow: you choose careful deliberation over brash decisions.","https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=591d350e0e6b3be6",-119.41793,36.77826,-119.41793,36.77826,"CA","Sanger"

"530",538,538,538,"Data Scientist","Pivotal Software","Washington, DC","LOCATION: Remote (home based) with some travel to New York, Washington DC, Boston.   About Us VIDEO  Founded in 2013, Pivotal Software, Inc. combines our leading cloud-native platform, tools, and methodology to empower the world's largest organizations to adapt to change and build great software. Our technology unleashes developer productivity, while fulfilling our mission to transform how the world builds software.  You  As a data scientist on Pivotal's Data Science team, you'll be working on a wide variety of data problems for a diverse range of clients. You will often be asked to learn new technologies and domains on the fly. You should be comfortable working under deadlines and making tough decisions. Consequently, you will frequently have to balance achieving an immediate goal with scalability and productionalizability.  The role offers room for personal and professional growth, and you won't be working in isolation. Data Science at Pivotal is an encouraging and supportive team, where ideas and challenges are addressed collaboratively. We're looking for the kind of person who will try and solve a problem on their own first, but isn't afraid to ask for help or say ""I don't know.""  Us  The Data Science team at Pivotal is primarily a consulting practice; we are tool agnostic, working with our customers to solve real world problems. Our customers, like us, are cross-disciplinary. We service engagements with use cases running from customer churn to optimization to detecting fraud and misconduct. We are not just doers, we are also educators and enablers.  Your Day  While there is no such thing as a ""typical day"", these are activities we frequently find ourselves doing:  Working with clients to uncover and frame new opportunities for data science. Clients often come to us without a clear understanding of what we can do, so this is our chance to open their eyes to new possibilities for their businesses. Exploring client datasets, looking for actionable insights we can present. Engineering features, training models, tuning hyperparameters and evaluating the results. We emphasize rigor, because data science done right at this stage leads to models that shine in production. Taking the models we build into production. This is an exciting stage for anyone who likes collaborating with engineering teams and seeing their model become real when users interact with it. Helping our clients develop their internal data science practices, from hiring and recruiting to data capturing, so that they can be successful when we hand off the project.  Required Skills / Experiences  Clear and empathetic communicator. You'll be the one sharing your insights with clients and stakeholders at check-ins, documenting your work, and even explaining your model to client data teams as part of a handoff. As such, communication and empathy are essential parts of your toolkit. Advanced knowledge of statistical modeling and/or machine learning methods. These are the tools we need to go from analysis to prediction. Strong programming skills. Left to our own devices most of us work in Python, but learning the client's tech stack is an important part of the job. Strong exploratory data analysis skills. Every engagement starts with an investigation of the data, and thorough EDA saves us a lot of headaches in the long run. Some travel is expected, depending on location and skillset. We mostly work out of the Pivotal office closest to the client, but sometimes we have to be on site for an extended period of time. At least a bachelor's degree in an analytical or technical field. This could be applied mathematics, statistics, computer science, operations research, economics, etc. Higher education welcome and encouraged.  This role will support US government clients that require US citizenship. Given this, US citizenship is required for you to apply.  Desired Skills / Experiences  2+ years of work in a data-centric field (data science or data engineering). Experience with relational databases. Exposure and experience working in a Linux environment. You have a specialization in an area like NLP, optimization, or image processing. Hands-on experience working in a distributed computing environment or proven theoretical understanding of parallelism.  Pivotal is an Equal Employment Opportunity employer that will consider all qualified applicants, regardless of race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, gender identity or expression, national origin, genetics, age, disability status, protected veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by applicable law.","https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=5f711e212efeb994",-77.03687,38.90719,-77.03687,38.90719,"DC","District of Freedom#8573311~!#, Washington"

Diversity Statement  At MagicLinks, we recognize diversity as something bigger than a search term or buzzword. Diversity here is an acknowledgement that the world is made up of many different facets, that all human beings have intrinsic value and worth, and are under no obligation to be anything other than their honest selves. Diversity means recognizing that different views and experiences are as important as those we’re already familiar with. It means taking radical ownership of the things we affect as individuals and as a company - including even inherited ways of doing things which may be destructive or biased and which we must work to change. It means looking at the world and making sure we embody as many of its best qualities as we can, and striving for that as a matter of principle, not as a marketing goal we check off a list.  Diversity goes beyond what we look like, who we are, who we love or how we think. Diversity is shorthand for an integrity-driven way of operating and growing every single day, and we wouldn’t have it any other way.

Diversity here is an acknowledgement that the world is made up of many different facets, that all human beings have intrinsic value and worth, and are under no obligation to be anything other than their honest selves. Diversity means recognizing that different views and experiences are as important as those we’re already familiar with. It means taking radical ownership of the things we affect as individuals and as a company - including even inherited ways of doing things which may be destructive or biased and which we must work to change. It means looking at the world and making sure we embody as many of its best qualities as we can, and striving for that as a matter of principle, not as a marketing goal we check off a list.  Diversity goes beyond what we look like, who we are, who we love or how we think. Diversity is shorthand for an integrity-driven way of operating and growing every single day, and we wouldn’t have it any other way.
